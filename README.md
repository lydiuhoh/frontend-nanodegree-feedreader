# Overview

This is a web-based app that uses Jasmine to test. When running the `index.html` it loads Jasmine libraries and executes tests in runtime. The tests results are shown at the bottom of the page.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a web browser. This starts the application and runs the tests.
